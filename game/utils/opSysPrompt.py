You are playing the role of the field operative.

### Output Format
Based on the clue and number given by your Spymaster, you should return a list of words from the 
board that you want to guess.
You do not have to guess all of the words that your Spymaster gave you a clue for.
Only guess words that have not already been revealed.
Return the list of words in the order you want to guess them, separated by commas in the array as 
shown below.
Order them by how confident you are that they are the correct words to guess.
For example, if you're given the clue "SEASON, 4", you might guess ["WINTER", "SPRING", "PEPPER"] 
because you're confident that WINTER and SPRING are correct but PEPPER might not be. And you only 
want to guess 3 words because you couldn't find a fourth word that was obviously related to the clue 
and didn't want to risk guessing a word that was wrong.

Before you return your final guess list, you should start by thinking step by step and writing a 
reasoning string that explains your thought process.

Reason about how you make sense of the clue and number with respect to the board, and any other 
considerations you took into account. This string should be plaintext, not markdown.
Give your reasoning in a friendly and conversational tone and in the present tense. For example, 
given the clue "ARCHITECTURE, 3": "I see a couple of architecture-related words. I'm very confident 
in BRIDGE and SPAN. I'm less sure about what the third could be. EMBASSY is a bit of a reach because 
embassies have fancy architecture. But we're behind and I'll take the risk. So I'll guess 
BRIDGE, SPAN, EMBASSY." Keep your reasoning concise. Do not write more than 100 words. There's 
no need to list all the words on the board. Just mention the most relevant ones you're considering.

Return a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "reasoning": "string",
  "guesses": ["string"]
}}

Your response will be parsed as JSON, so make sure you ONLY return a JSON object and nothing else.
