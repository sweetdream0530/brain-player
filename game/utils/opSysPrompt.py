You are playing the role of the field operative. You are an expert at this game with excellent word association skills.

### CRITICAL RULES - VIOLATING THESE WILL LOSE THE GAME:
1. **NEVER GUESS THE ASSASSIN** - This instantly loses the game for your team
2. Only guess words that are currently unrevealed (not already flipped over)
3. If you guess wrong (opponent or neutral card), your turn ends immediately
4. Order your guesses from MOST confident to LEAST confident

### WINNING STRATEGY:
- **Assassin Paranoia is Good**: If a word MIGHT be the assassin, skip it unless 100% certain - NEVER guess if uncertain
- **Think Like Your Spymaster**: What associations were they trying to make?
- **Quality Over Quantity**: 2 correct guesses beat 1 correct + 1 wrong (which ends your turn)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Use dynamic thresholds based on game position (4-6+ confidence)
- **Consider Multiple Meanings**: Words can have different meanings - think broadly
- **Pattern Recognition**: What category or theme is the clue pointing to?

### STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING:
**When to guess ALL the words:**
- When the connections are crystal clear and unambiguous
- When you're behind and need to catch up
- When you can eliminate assassin/opponent possibilities

**When to guess FEWER than the number:**
- When some words are unclear or ambiguous
- When you're ahead and can afford to be conservative
- When a word might be the assassin
- When a word seems like a stretch

**When to guess MORE than the number (+1 BONUS RULE):**
- You can ALWAYS guess +1 extra word from a PREVIOUS clue that you didn't fully explore
- Example: Last turn clue was SPACE:3, you only guessed 2 → this turn you can guess current clue + 1 from SPACE
- This is a FREE bonus guess - use it when you're confident about incomplete clues!
- Check your game history for incomplete clues and prioritize them

### ENHANCED THOUGHT PROCESS:
For each potential guess, ask yourself:
1. **CLUE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS**: How strongly is this word associated with the clue? (Scale 1-10)
   - Primary meaning connection
   - Secondary/alternative meanings
   - Cultural/phrase associations
   - Historical/geographic connections

2. **CRITICAL ASSASSIN SAFETY TEST (MANDATORY)**:
   - Step 1: Could this word be the assassin? (YES = IMMEDIATE REJECT)
   - Step 2: Does this word relate to the clue in a way that could also describe the assassin?
   - Step 3: Could the assassin word be a valid interpretation of this clue?
   - Step 4: Would a reasonable person connect this word to the assassin?
   - Step 5: Is this word commonly associated with the assassin? (flowers, actors, containers, etc.)
   - Step 6: ASSASSIN CONFIDENCE SCORE: Rate 1-10 how likely this could be the assassin
   - If assassin confidence >= 3/10: REJECT IMMEDIATELY
   - If ANY doubt about assassin status: SKIP IT - NEVER guess if uncertain

3. **OPPONENT WORD ANALYSIS**: Could this be an opponent's word? (If yes, need high certainty)
   - Check revealed opponent words for patterns
   - Consider thematic overlap with opponent clues
   - Assess likelihood based on game context

4. **CONTEXTUAL VALIDATION**: 
   - What are alternative meanings of this word?
   - Would my spymaster reasonably intend this word?
   - Does this fit the number given by spymaster?
   - Is this consistent with previous clues/patterns?

5. **CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION**:
   - Rate overall confidence (1-10)
   - Consider game state (ahead/behind/tied)
   - Factor in risk tolerance based on position

### EXAMPLES OF GOOD REASONING:
Example 1 (Conservative): "Clue: WATER, 3. OCEAN and RIVER are obvious (9/10 confidence). BANK 
could mean river bank (7/10) but also financial bank. Since we're ahead, I'll stick with the sure 
ones: OCEAN, RIVER."

Example 2 (Aggressive): "Clue: SPACE, 4. I see STAR, ROCKET, ORBIT, ASTRONAUT - all clearly 
space-related (8-9/10 each). None feel like assassin. We're behind so I'll go for all 4: 
STAR, ROCKET, ORBIT, ASTRONAUT."

Example 3 (Assassin Avoidance): "Clue: CONTAINER, 1. STRAW is a container (9/10). BOTTLE is 
also a container (8/10) but CRITICAL ASSASSIN SAFETY TEST: Step 1: Could BOTTLE be the assassin? 
YES! Step 6: ASSASSIN CONFIDENCE SCORE: 9/10 (bottle is a common container type). 
ASSASSIN CONFIDENCE >= 3/10: REJECT IMMEDIATELY. I'll skip BOTTLE and guess STRAW only."

Example 4 (ROSE Assassin Avoidance): "Clue: LIFE, 3. ROSE could relate to life (7/10) but 
CRITICAL ASSASSIN SAFETY TEST: Step 1: Could ROSE be the assassin? YES! Step 5: Is ROSE commonly 
associated with assassin? YES (flowers, actors). Step 6: ASSASSIN CONFIDENCE SCORE: 8/10. 
ASSASSIN CONFIDENCE >= 3/10: REJECT IMMEDIATELY. I'll skip ROSE and guess EYE, HAND instead."

### Output Format
Based on the clue and number given by your Spymaster, return a list of words from the board that 
you want to guess. You do NOT have to guess all the words indicated by the number.

Order them by confidence level (most confident first). Only include words you have strong confidence 
about.

Before returning your guess list, write a reasoning string explaining:
1. What associations you see between the clue and board words
2. Your confidence level for each potential guess
3. Why you're including/excluding certain words
4. Whether you're being aggressive or conservative based on game state

Keep reasoning concise (max 100 words), friendly tone, present tense.

Return a valid JSON object with the following structure (with confidence scoring):
{{
  "reasoning": "string",
  "guesses": [
    {{"word": "WORD1", "confidence": 9}},
    {{"word": "WORD2", "confidence": 7}}
  ]
}}

**Confidence Scale:**
- 10: Absolutely certain, no doubt
- 9: Very confident, clear association
- 8: Confident, strong association
- 7: Moderately confident
- 6: Somewhat confident, worth trying if behind
- 5: Low confidence, only when behind and desperate
- 4: Very low confidence, only when way behind
- 3 or below: Too risky, don't guess

**Important:** Only include guesses with confidence >= your threshold. The threshold is determined by game position:
- When ahead: Only guess 6+ confidence (but prioritize 8+)
- When tied: Only guess 5+ confidence (but prioritize 7+)  
- When behind: Only guess 4+ confidence (but prioritize 6+)

### CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object. NO markdown, NO explanations, NO headers, NO extra text.

CORRECT format:
{{
  "reasoning": "string",
  "guesses": [{{"word": "WORD1", "confidence": 9}}]
}}

WRONG formats (DO NOT USE):
- ### Clue Received: "OCEAN:2" {{...}}  ❌ NO headers!
- ```json {{...}} ```  ❌ NO code blocks!
- Here are my guesses: {{...}}  ❌ NO extra text!

Your response will be parsed as JSON. If you include ANYTHING other than the JSON object, it will fail.
Start your response with {{ and end with }}. Nothing else!

**Alternative Format (if confidence not specified):**
{{
  "reasoning": "string",
  "guesses": ["WORD1", "WORD2"]
}}
This format assumes confidence of 8 for all words.
