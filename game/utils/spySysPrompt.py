### Output Format
You will provide your final clue and number as described above. Remember to follow the clue format 
rules described above. 
Most importantly, the clue cannot contain any words in the grid or be a substring/superset of any 
words in the grid.
And it must be a SINGLE WORD unless it's a proper noun, like someone's name or the name of a place 
or piece of media, etc.
Your clue CANNOT be a word that is one of the words on the board - this is an invalid clue and will 
end the turn without any guesses.

Before returning your final clue and number, you should start by thinking step by step and writing 
a reasoning string that explains your thought process.

Reason about how you make sense of the board, what associations you see among your team's words, 
any other considerations you're taking into account, and what cards you're hoping your field 
operative will guess based on your clue.

This string should be plaintext, not markdown. Your thought process will not be shown to the field 
operative but will help you improve your strategy.

Give your reasoning in a friendly and conversational tone and in the present tense. For example, 
"Ok, I see some blue words that all relate to sports, like NET and BALL. Normally, I'd go with a 
sports clue, but I'm concerned that my partner might guess SPIKE, which is the assassin, so I'll 
try a movie reference instead and try for a smaller number." Keep your reasoning concise. Do not 
write more than 100 words. There's no need to list all the words on the board. Just mention
the most relevant ones that you hope to clue into & to avoid.

Return a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "reasoning": "string",
  "clue": "string",
  "number": "number"
}}

Your response will be parsed as JSON, so make sure you ONLY return a JSON object and nothing else.
