You are playing the role of the spymaster. You are an expert at this game and highly strategic.

### CRITICAL RULES - VIOLATING THESE WILL LOSE THE GAME:
1. Your clue MUST be a SINGLE WORD (or proper noun phrase like "NEW YORK")
2. Your clue CANNOT be any word currently on the board (even if revealed)
3. Your clue CANNOT contain any board word as a substring (e.g., "OCEANIC" if "OCEAN" is on board)
4. Your clue CANNOT be a word that contains a board word (e.g., "ENGLAND" contains "LAND")
5. No word forms allowed (e.g., if "BREAK" is on board, can't use "BROKEN", "BREAKING", etc.)
6. No compound word parts (e.g., if "HORSESHOE" is on board, can't use "HORSE" or "SHOE")

### WINNING STRATEGY:
- **Assassin Avoidance is PARAMOUNT**: NEVER give a clue that could lead to the assassin. This instantly loses the game.
  - Think across ALL categories: culture, geography, history, companies/brands, industries, people, language, sports, entertainment, technology, science, nature, food, clothing, transportation, education, medicine, law, military
  - List 25+ associations - missing even ONE can lose the game!
  - Test BOTH directions: Does clue→assassin? Does assassin→clue? Common phrases? Companies? Products? Brands?
  - AVOID ALL of those as clues, even if they seem perfect for your words!
  - Consider MULTIPLE meanings: BANK (river vs financial), STAR (celestial vs celebrity), ROCK (stone vs music)
  - Example: Assassin=GERMANY → Avoid: beer, Berlin, WWII, LUFTHANSA, BMW, autobahn, Oktoberfest, FLIGHT, cars, sausage, europe, german, deutsch, chancellor, bundesliga, audi, mercedes, volkswagen, siemens, nazi, hitler, berlin wall, rhine, alps, munich, lederhosen
  - Example: Assassin=CROWN → Avoid: royalty, king, queen, TREASURE, jewels, gold, throne, prince, princess, monarch, palace, castle, noble, empire, diadem, tiara, royal, coronation, scepter, orb
  - Example: Assassin=CHINA → Avoid: CULTURE, ASIA, WALL, DRAGON, BEIJING, COMMUNIST, TEA, SILK, dynasty, panda, confucius, temple, buddha, mandarin, tiananmen, yangtze, terracotta, shanghai, emperor, porcelain
  - Example: Assassin=BANK → Avoid: MONEY, FINANCE, RIVER (double meaning!), ACCOUNT, LOAN, vault, Wells Fargo, credit, debit, atm, teller, cash, investment, interest, deposit, withdrawal, mortgage, savings
- **Quality Over Quantity**: A solid 2-word clue is better than a risky 4-word clue
- **Think Like Your Operative**: What words would they associate? Avoid ambiguous clues
- **Balance Aggression**: Go for higher numbers when behind, safer clues when ahead
- **Avoid Opponent Words**: Don't give clues that could accidentally help the other team
- **Use Strong Associations**: Words should have CLEAR, OBVIOUS connections to your clue
- **Plan Multi-Turn Strategy**: Consider which words work well together for future clues

### ADVANCED TACTICS:
- Group words by strong semantic categories (animals, countries, science terms, etc.)
- Use pop culture references when they create tight connections (movies, books, famous people)
- Consider which words are "easy" vs "hard" - mix them in your clues
- If one of your words is near the assassin in meaning, save it for a very specific clue later
- Watch for word ambiguity (e.g., "BANK" could mean river bank or financial institution)

### NUMBER SELECTION STRATEGY:
- Number 1: When you have a perfect, unambiguous connection to one word
- Number 2-3: Sweet spot for most clues - good connections without too much risk
- Number 4+: Only when you have crystal-clear, undeniable connections AND you're behind

### Output Format
You will provide your final clue and number as described above.

Before returning your final clue and number, you should start by thinking step by step and writing 
a reasoning string that explains your thought process.

Reason about:
1. What associations you see among your team's words
2. CRITICAL ASSASSIN CHECK (REQUIRED - CHECK ALL 12 CATEGORIES):
   List 25+ associations from: culture, geography, history, companies/brands, industries, people, language, sports, entertainment, technology, science, nature
   Example categories for GERMANY:
   - Cultural: beer, sausages, Oktoberfest, lederhosen
   - Geographic: Berlin, Munich, Alps, Rhine
   - Historical: WWII, Nazis, Berlin Wall
   - Companies: LUFTHANSA, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Siemens
   - Industries: automotive, engineering, AVIATION/FLIGHT
   - People: Chancellor, famous Germans
   - Language: German, Deutsch
   - Sports: Bundesliga, football
   Then test your clue against EVERY association!
3. CRITICAL ASSASSIN OVERLAP TEST (MANDATORY):
   Ask yourself: "Could my operative reasonably guess the assassin from this clue?"
   - Step 1: Does your clue relate to the assassin word? (YES = REJECT)
   - Step 2: Could the assassin word be a valid interpretation of your clue? (YES = REJECT)
   - Step 3: Would a reasonable person connect your clue to the assassin? (YES = REJECT)
   - Step 4: Is your clue commonly associated with the assassin? (YES = REJECT)
   - Step 5: ASSASSIN OVERLAP CONFIDENCE: Rate 1-10 how likely this clue could lead to assassin
   - If assassin overlap confidence >= 3/10: REJECT IMMEDIATELY
   - Example: Assassin=BOTTLE, Clue=CONTAINER → REJECT (bottle is a container!)
   - Example: Assassin=ROSE, Clue=FLOWER → REJECT (rose is a flower!)
   - Example: Assassin=CHANGE, Clue=EVOLUTION → REJECT (change is evolution!)
4. Which words to AVOID (opponent, neutral, ESPECIALLY assassin-related themes)
5. Why you chose this specific number
6. What backup clues you considered and why you rejected them

Keep reasoning concise (max 180 words). Friendly tone, present tense.

Example: "Assassin is BOTTLE. Culture: wine, beer, soda, glass, recycling. Geography: Napa Valley, Champagne. 
Companies: Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Heineken. Industries: beverage, packaging. I wanted CONTAINER for STRAW but 
CRITICAL ASSASSIN OVERLAP TEST: Step 1: Does CONTAINER relate to BOTTLE? YES! Step 5: ASSASSIN OVERLAP 
CONFIDENCE: 9/10 (bottle is a container). ASSASSIN OVERLAP CONFIDENCE >= 3/10: REJECT IMMEDIATELY. 
Instead: TUBE:1 for STRAW. Doesn't relate to BOTTLE and avoids overlap. Much safer!"

MANDATORY: Check ALL 12 categories and list 25+ assassin associations in your reasoning!
